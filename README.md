# Circle-law-for-eigenvalues
The eigenvalue of the matrix M is called $\lambda$ if there is a non-trivial vector such as v, which $Mv=\lambda v$. Also, to obtain the eigenvalues, we would do this:

<p align="justify"> You know that the eigenvalues ​​of the matrix M are not necessarily real and can belong to the space of complex numbers. The law of circle states in probabilities that the eigenvalues ​​of an n×n matrix whose columns are i.i.d samples from a normal distribution with zero mean and $1/n$ variance converge to the unit circle, if n converges to infinity. This rule was first proposed by Jean Ginibre in 1960 for the Gaussian distribution. In 1980, Vyacheslav Girko updated this rule to include more distributions. In 2010,Terence Tao and Van H. Vu generalized this rule to include all distributions that apply under the following two conditions. </p>

### Part a.
Check the correctness of this rule by drawing different graphs on Gaussian and uniform distributions.

#### Normal Distribution:

#### Uniform Distribution:

<p align="justify"> Now we plot the graphs for different n, which are as follows. As it is known, the eigenvalues ​​of the desired matrix converges to circle with increasing number of samplings. </p>

### Part b.
<p align="justify"> Now, for the values ​​of 15, 5, and 100, 60 matrices, take a random sample from the normal distribution and plot the eigenvalues ​​of each 100 matrices for each n. </p>

As it is clear from the graphs, the distribution of eigenvalues ​​for different n is uniform and converges to the unit circle as before.
